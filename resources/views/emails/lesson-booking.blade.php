Hi, {{ $details['receiver'] }}

	<p>Did you know that on Tokatif, you have 5 discounted Trial Lessons to use?</p>

	<p>As you go on a journey to find the right teacher for yourself, these Trial Lessons give you the opportunity to try lessons from various teachers, as you before you fully commit to that teacher.</p>

	<p>It is important to share your goals and motivations with your teacher during these Trial Lessons and ask all the questions about the lesson and their teaching style to prevent misunderstandings and confusion in the future.</p>

	<p>A great teacher makes all the difference when it comes to learning a language, so why not find and book a Trial Lesson?</p>
